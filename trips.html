The "Journeys" section features a grid of interactive cards for the six trips. Clicking a card dynamically populates a detailed view below it, featuring the trip's description, an interactive daily timeline, and a comparative radar chart. This structure was chosen to prioritize the exciting travel options, allowing users to easily compare and explore them without leaving the page, while keeping essential practical information neatly organized and accessible in a separate, collapsible section. This non-linear approach enhances user engagement and simplifies information discovery compared to the original report's linear format. -->
